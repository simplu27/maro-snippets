Setting Up a 503 ’Service Unavailable’ Status

(From book: Wordpress Pushing the Limits - McCollin, Rachel)

The simplest way to do this on a WordPress site is by using a plugin. Plugins such as Site Maintenance
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wet-maintenance/) and Ultimate Coming Soon
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ultimate-coming-soon-page/) include the option
to set up a 503 redirect, which directs visitors to your teaser page and informs search engines that the site is
temporarily unavailable and has not disappeared in a puff of smoke. 

What if you don’t want to use a plugin, or you’re developing a teaser page or site outside of WordPress? It’s still
pretty simple—follow these steps:

	1. Create a blank file called 503.php in the root directory of your domain.
	2. Type the following code into the blank file:
			<?php
				header(“HTTP/1.1 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable”);
				header(“status: 503 Service temporarily Unavailable”);
				header(“Retry-After: Mon 1 April 2013 00:00 GMT”);
			?>
		The preceding code tells search engines that the site is temporarily unavailable and specifies when to crawl
		the site again. This information is output in the HTTP response headers before any page content is returned
		and won’t be visible to visitors.
	3. Open the .htaccess file in your root directory (if you don’t have one, create one), and add the following to it:

			<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
				ErrorDocument 503 /503.php
				RewriteEngine on
				RewriteBase /
				RewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} !=503
				RewriteCond %{REMOTE_HOST} !^111\.111\.111\.111$
				RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !robots\.txt$ [NC]
				RewriteRule ^ - [L,R=503]
			</IfModule>

	4. Save both files and access your site in a browser. You will see a blank screen.

	5. You need to tell visitors what’s going on. To do this, simply add some markup to the 503.php file, such as the following:
		<!DOCTYPE HTML>
		<html>
			<head>
			<title>Error 503 service temporarily unavailable</title>
			</head>
			<body>
				<h1>This site is being redeveloped</h1>
			<p>Please come back soon to see our fabulous new site!</p>
			</body>
		</html>

	6. Save the file, return to your site, and refresh the browser. You’ll now see something more useful,
